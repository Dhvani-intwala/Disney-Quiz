### **Purpose**
The aim of this project is to deliver an interactive, engaging quiz that is visually and functionally satisfying for the user to play.
This ten-question quiz game was designed for fans of Disney world to test their knowledge and make a competition quiz game with other user friends/family by comparing their High scores.
To achieve the strategic goals I implemented the following features:-
- simple website layout with the content located in the center of the viewport
- easy to click buttons both on computers and mobile touch interfaces
- eye-pleasing graphics to make the experience entertaining.

### **User Goal**
- as a user i want to:
    - navigate easily through the page,
    - see a clean interface and be able to track progress/score,
    - know how many questions I have left to answer,
    - enjoy the game,
    - see my score after I answer the last question,
    - be able to re-play the game and compare my score
    - As a user, I want a responsive site so I can play the game on any device.

## User experience (UX/UI)
### **Colour Palatte**
- The palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.
- I have used #033c48cb for background for all pages,       
  #000000 and #fff both to color the text.
- I have used #0bdf24 to display the correct answer.
- I have used #e50e0e to display the wrong answers.

### **Typography**
- Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the website.
    - For the Page title I have used the google font Cinzel.
    - For the body page I have used the google font Nova Square cursive.

### **Wireframe**
- To create the wireframe I used the Balsamiq Wireframing Software.

### **game page**

- The game page shows a question and gives the player 4 answer choices to choose from.
- On hover, the answer option bars will expand, creating a more visual representation of what is about to be selected
- When the user plays the game, and if the user gives the wrong answer, the quiz will not show the correct answer, this would make the user more curious, and the user would like to know the Correct answer. Thus making the quiz more interesting, and the user will play the game again to achieve high scores.
- A score count adds hundreds (100) each time the user selects a correct answer. The scoreboard will appear on the top right-hand side during the quiz. 
- Option will turn green if the user selects the correct answer. 
- Option will turn red if the user selects the incorrect answer. 
- On the top left-hand side, progress bar is shown, which will update the user on which questions the user is and how many remaining questions are still left.
