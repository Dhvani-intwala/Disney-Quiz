### **Purpose**
The aim of this project is to deliver an interactive, engaging quiz that is visually and functionally satisfying for the user to play.
This ten-question quiz game was designed for fans of Disney world to test their knowledge and make a competition quiz game with other user friends/family by comparing their High scores.
To achieve the strategic goals I implemented the following features:-
- simple website layout with the content located in the center of the viewport
- easy to click buttons both on computers and mobile touch interfaces
- eye-pleasing graphics to make the experience entertaining.

### **User Goal**
- as a user i want to:
    - navigate easily through the page,
    - see a clean interface and be able to track progress/score,
    - know how many questions I have left to answer,
    - enjoy the game,
    - see my score after I answer the last question,
    - be able to re-play the game and compare my score
    - As a user, I want a responsive site so I can play the game on any device.

## User experience (UX/UI)
### **Colour Palatte**
- The palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.
- I have used #033c48cb for background for all pages,       
  #000000 and #fff both to color the text.
- I have used #0bdf24 to display the correct answer.
- I have used #e50e0e to display the wrong answers.

### **Typography**
- Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the website.
    - For the Page title I have used the google font Cinzel.
    - For the body page I have used the google font Nova Square cursive.

### **Wireframe**
- To create the wireframe I used the Balsamiq Wireframing Software.
